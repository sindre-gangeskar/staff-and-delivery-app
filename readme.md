# Staff And Delivery App

Projected created as the semester project assignment. 

# About
This app will generate random users using randomuser API and append them dynamically to the respective tables. 
You can clock each user in / out with a desired amount of time (max 1380) minutes. 

If they're not back by the duration in minutes, they'll be considered 'late' and a toast will show with the staff or delivery driver's information.

You can create a delivery by filling in the fields in 'Schedule Delivery'. 
Assign the delivery a full name, phone number, vehicle type and delivery address to successfully create a delivery. 

This project uses Regex validation for generating the staff user and during the creation of a new delivery.
